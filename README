This is Business::OnlinePayment::OCV, an Business::OnlinePayment backend
module for the Ingenico Online Credit Verification Server (OCV).  It is only
useful if you have a merchant account with Ingenico:
http://www.ingenico.com.au

Currently, it is mostly a wrapper around Business::OCV written by Benjamin
Low <b.d.low@unsw.edu.au>.  Eventually it will be self-contained.

There are tests in t2/ that may be useful to you once you have a test server
setup.

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments through
online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (If you
like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
solution").
